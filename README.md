**OneUptime is the complete open-source observability platform.**

OneUptime monitors your website, dashboards, API's, and more and alerts your team when downtime happens. We also give you a Status Page which keeps your customers looped in and improves transparency.

OneUptime does:

-   Uptime Monitoring, replaces tools like Pingdom
-   Status Page, replaces tools like StatusPage.io
-   Incident Management, replaces tools like Incident.io
-   On-call rotation and alerts, replaces tools like PagerDuty
-   Tests, replaces tools like Postman (Coming soon)
-   Security, replaces tools like Snyk (Coming soon)
-   Logs Management, replaces tools like Loggly (Coming soon)
-   Performance Monitoring, replaces tools like NewRelic (Coming soon)
-   Error Tracking, replaces tools like Sentry (Coming soon)

All under one platform.

## Get started for free

### OneUptime Cloud

The fastest and most reliable way to get started with OneUptime is signing up for free to [OneUptime Cloud](https://oneuptime.com). By using the hosted cloud service, you also support by funding OneUptime open source development. 

### Open-source hobby single-server deploy with Docker Compose.

Deploy a single-server instance with docker compose on Debian / Ubuntu (we only support Debian / Ubuntu as of today). We recommend OneUptime on 16 GB / 8 Core Ubuntu Server. However you can run an instance on a much smaller server.

Please make sure you have: 
- Docker and Docker Compose installed.

To install OneUptime: 

```
# Clone this repo and cd into it.
git clone https://github.com/OneUptime/oneuptime.git
cd oneuptime

# Please make sure you're on release branch.
git checkout release

# Copy config.example.env to config.env
cp config.example.env config.env

# IMPORTANT: Edit config.env file. Please make sure you have random secrets.

npm start
```

If you don't like to use npm or do not have it installed, run this instead: 

```
# Read env vars from config.env file and run docker-compose up.
export $(grep -v '^#' config.env | xargs) && docker compose up --remove-orphans -d
```

To update: 

```
git checkout release # Please make sure you're on release branch.
git pull
npm run update
```

OneUptime should run at: http://localhost. You need to register a new account for your instance to start using it. If you would like to use https, please use a reverse proxy like Nginx.

### Development

For local development you need to use docker-compose.dev.yml file. 

You need to make sure you have: 
- Docker and Docker compose installed. 
- Node.js and NPM installed.

```
# Clone this repo and cd into it.
git clone https://github.com/OneUptime/oneuptime.git
cd oneuptime

# Copy config.example.env to config.env
cp config.example.env config.env

# Since this is dev, you don't have to edit any of those values in config.env. You can, but that's optional.
npm run dev
```
